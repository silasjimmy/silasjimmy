## Hello!

Hi, I’m Silas Jimmy, a Fullstack Software Engineer with more than three years of experience in programming and software development.

I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, and I love building interactive and seamless experiences using AngularJS and VueJS. My passion for art and calligraphy led me to become a self-taught UX/UI designer, giving me a keen eye for design and a deep understanding of developing user-friendly interfaces using Figma.

As a strategic thinker and problem solver, I focus on both the big picture and crucial details, allowing me to create intuitive, high-performing applications that meet both customer needs and business objectives.

If you're looking for a Frontend Engineer who can bring creativity, technical expertise, and user-first design to your web and mobile applications, let’s connect! I’d love to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
