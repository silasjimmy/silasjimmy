## Hello!

I am Silas, a **Computer Science graduate** and a passionate **Software developer**. My skills and expertise span across the entire software development process. I design and develop front-end web interfaces, design the back-end of the application and connect the two using APIs to communicate together. I also manage the infrastructure by designing unit and intergration tests to evaluate the performance so to ensure high availability of the application.

I love collaborating with others on projects that deal with web and mobile applications. Currently i am looking for a role as a **Software Engineer** in any business environment.
